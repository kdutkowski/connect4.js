# Connect Four 

This is a very basic implementation of [Connect Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_four) in JavaScript. It comes with AI players using [Alpha-Beta pruning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning).
It runs on node.js. 

    To generate possible boards `cd js && node main.js 2> /dev/null`

    
    To add responses to already generated boards `node generateResponses.js 6 7 6x7.csv > a.csv`
